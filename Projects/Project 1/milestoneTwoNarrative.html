                    The artifact that I have completed for this milestone is a static view of the mobile game application that I am developing for this course. It is an enhancement from a text-based game that previously could only run in a terminal window. The original text-based game was created as my first project in the Computer Science program.

                    I have selected the original text-based game to showcase my abilities from the start of the Computer Science program to now. For this milestone, I enhanced the artifact by creating a static view of what will be a fully functional mobile application. By doing this, I was able to showcase my ability to design a mobile application.

                <strong>Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?</strong>

                    I do feel that I met the course outcomes that I planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One. I planned to meet the following outcomes: Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science. Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. I feel that by taking the format of the original artifact, which was terminal-based, and enhancing it into a static view of a mobile application as well as making sure to use proper naming conventions and in-line comments I was able to meet these outcomes.

            <h1>
                <strong>Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?</strong>
            </h1>
    
            <div class="question-response">
                <p>
                While enhancing and modifying the artifact I had to determine exactly how I wanted the different screens to be designed. For the login screen, I had to decide if I wanted the login and account creation processes to be together on one screen or separately on two different screens. I decided to make them separate because I felt the application flows better this way. Additionally, the most challenging portion of enhancing and modifying the original artifact was designing the gameplay screen. I had the idea to make this a retro-style game since it is text-based, so I went with a retro-style look. When creating this look, determining the size and placement for each component took a good amount of thought. However, this critical thinking allowed me to learn the comfortable placement of screen components for a mobile application and will certainly benefit me in the future.
