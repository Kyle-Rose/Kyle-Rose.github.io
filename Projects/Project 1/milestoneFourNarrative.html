                    The artifact that I have completed for this milestone is the final step in transforming my original artifact into a fully functional mobile application. The original artifact is a text-based game that I programmed for my first project in the Computer Science Program. The original text-based game could only run in a terminal window. In Milestone Two, I created a static view of the application. In Milestone Three, I completed the gameplay functionality for the application. For this Milestone, I completed the login functionality for the application.

                    I have selected the original text-based game to showcase my abilities from the start of the Computer Science program to now. For this milestone, I enhanced the artifact by programming the login functionality for the application. For the login functionality to be complete, I had to create a database, and program the logic to both create an account and login to the application using the created account. By doing this, I was able to showcase my ability to create a database and connect the database with other components of a mobile application.

                    I did meet the course outcome that I planned to with this enhancement in Module One. The outcome that I planned to meet was, Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources. I feel that I was able to achieve this outcome by adding the login screen to the application as an extra layer of security. I do not have any updates to my outcome-coverage plans.

                <strong>Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?</strong>

            <div class="question-response">
                <p>
                    This enhancement was a pretty smooth process for me. I have created a login screen for a mobile application before, however, the last one that I created was an all-in-one screen, meaning both the login and account creation components worked together on one screen. I didn’t feel that this design was right for this application, so I made the login and account creation components separate. The logic was similar to the all-in-one screen process, so it wasn’t too challenging to divide the components up. However, having learned how to design and program the login and account creation components on two different screens will be very beneficial for future projects.
