                    The artifact that I have completed for this milestone is the second step to transforming my original artifact into a fully functional mobile application. The original artifact is a text-based game that I programmed for my first project in the Computer Science Program. The original text-based game could only run in a terminal window. In Milestone Two, I created a static view of the application. In this milestone, I completed the gameplay functionality for the application.

                    I have selected the original text-based game to showcase my abilities from the start of the Computer Science program to now. For this milestone, I enhanced the artifact by programming the gameplay functionality for the application. The gameplay now runs on a retro-style virtual device with buttons as input. When programming the gameplay, I had to adjust the algorithm of the game to take in the buttons as input rather than the original text input that came from the terminal window. I was able to achieve this by putting if-then conditions under each button’s OnClickListener. The original gameplay operated in a while loop, but since the buttons are always listening for input, I didn’t need to use a loop. I also had to change the way the data was structured. The game was originally written in Python, and the rooms map was created using a dictionary. Since I am transforming the project into Java as part of my enhancement process, I had to structure the rooms map using a hash map that stored each room as a String, Map key-value pair.

                    I did meet the course outcome that I planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One. The outcome that I planned to meet was, Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. I feel that I was able to achieve this outcome by adjusting the algorithms and data structures of the original game to meet the expectations of my fully functional mobile application. One change that I made with my enhancement plan is pushing back the login functionality to Milestone Four. I felt that since this relies on the database to operate, it was more fitting to complete for Milestone Four instead. However, this doesn’t change my outcome-coverage plans.

                    This milestone really tested my ability to innovate and enhance my original artifact. Creating a static view of the application took some critical thought for design choices and component placement. However, actually transforming the gameplay functionality to fit the new design was a much more rigorous process. The hardest part for me to figure out was how to take input for the game. Since I am switching the gameplay functionality from text input to button input, I had to determine how this would fit into the gameplay algorithm. Eventually, I realized that since the buttons were always listening for input with the OnClickListeners, I could put movement conditions under each OnClickListener. Once I figured this out, along with restructuring the data from a dictionary to a map, programming the rest of the gameplay functionality was a pretty seamless process. One additional component that I added to the design of the application during this process was a Restart button on the gameplay screen. I chose to incorporate this button both as a way for the user to restart the game from any point, as well as Restart the game if the user has won and wants to play the game again.
