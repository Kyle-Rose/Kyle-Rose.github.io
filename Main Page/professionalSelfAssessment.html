                    Completing my coursework throughout the program and developing my ePortfolio has helped me showcase my strengths, shape my professional goals and values, and prepare to enter and/or become more employable in the computer science field in many ways. Before entering the computer science program, I did not have much experience with computer science. The program has taught me fundamental computer science concepts including software engineering, data structures and algorithms, databases, and security. I was able to learn and apply these concepts by completing various projects including a command line text-based game, an informative style desktop application, a dashboard-style web application, an Express web application that featured a static client-facing side and a dynamic admin-facing side, creating a virtual office space scene using OpenGL, solving a pathfinding problem using AI, a weight-tracking mobile application, and an enhanced text-based game in the form of a mobile application. Some of the languages that I have learned by completing my coursework throughout the program include C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, CSS, HTML, and OpenGL. The program has also taught me the business side of the computer science industry including collaborating in a team environment and communicating with stakeholders. I was able to learn this through simulated software development life cycles where I took the role of each member of a development team.

                    This ePortfolio was completed along with an enhanced artifact as the final project for my Computer Science Capstone course. The goal of the final project for this course was to select an original artifact and enhance it in three categories: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. The artifact that I selected to enhance for this course was the first project that I completed for the computer science program which was a command-line text-based game. I enhanced the original text-based game by turning it into a fully functional mobile application complete with a login screen, a gameplay screen, and a database. By completing this mobile application, I was able to showcase my abilities and knowledge in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, databases, and security. A further breakdown of this project can be found under the projects section of my ePortfolio.
